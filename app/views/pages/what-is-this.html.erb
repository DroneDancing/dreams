          <p>Where are we in 29 years? We invite artists and creators to take us into scenarios we wouldn't have imagined. Present your creation, your story, your experience. Show exciting implications of technologies not yet invented or envision dystopias.</p>

          <p>Färgfabriken i Stockholm is your canvas of over 500m2 for co-creative expression.</p>

          <h1>Become a dreaming drone</h1>

          <p>Drones of all types are welcome to the collective. Dream of art installations, workshops, videos, performances and experiences. You can weld, build, paint, program, play music or create a robotic architecture. Maybe you are a great storyteller, or a workshop host. Maybe you just want to help the people building, by making sandwiches and serving tea. Every effort counts in this creative community, and is welcome.</p>

          <h1>Start by creating a Dream</h1>
          <p>This is where we imagine and show our ideas. It's where we explore each others ideas, and decide who gets funding, and how much. This happens through everyone in the online community receiving virtual coins, which they can use to fund their favorite projects.</p>

          <p>Building happens between April 26, 2018 (when the funding has been allocated) and the opening of the event, September 1st. You can start right now. Färgfabriken is booked for build-up a week before opening. After closing September 16th, we clean up and leave the place as we found it. </p>
